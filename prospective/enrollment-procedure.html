        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.intro">Enrolment usually runs smoothly, but not always. Here you will find a brief overview of what we have experienced so far in a similar form, what you can therefore look out for and how you can deal with it if necessary.</p>

        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.before_start">Enrollment before starting your studies:</p>
        
        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.check_email">As soon as you have sent your enrollment, check your emails and SPAM regularly. Explanation: You will receive an email with the steps you still need to take for your final enrollment:</p>
        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.activate_account">Activate LMU user account. There is a link that is only valid for 72 hours. And even if a start date is given in the enrollment deadlines, this email may arrive as soon as your papers have arrived at the Studentenkanzlei. If you miss this deadline, the email will tell you how to proceed. The deadline for transferring the semester fee will NOT be extended.</p>
        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.transfer_fee">Transfer the semester fee as soon as possible. If you miss this deadline, you will receive a notification that your conditional enrollment has been canceled.</p>
        <p>
          <span data-translate="enrollment_procedure.apply_card">Apply for your LMU Card.</span> 
          <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/structure/central-university-administration/it-services-division-vi/it-service-desk/" data-translate="enrollment_procedure.apply_card_link">https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/structure/central-university-administration/it-services-division-vi/it-service-desk/</a>
        </p>

        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.after_start">Enrollment after the start of the semester:</p>
        <p data-translate="enrollment_procedure.after_start_info">A very small percentage of our students are not enrolled before the start of the semester. First of all, don't panic! This is purely an administrative problem and you will certainly still get your admissions. Unfortunately, there are many hurdles to overcome. Most lectures now use platforms such as Moodle, Uni2Work or LSF. You won't have access to these without an LMU user ID. You should take part in our Ophase shortly before the start of your studies. We can then help you further.</p>
