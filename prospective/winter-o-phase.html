        <p><b>Note: The O-Phase will be nearly completely in German!</b></p>

        <p>As this is an Event created for starting Bachelor Students and nearly all lectures in our Bachelor programs are held only in German, we hold it in German. But of course it is no problem if you ask us questions in English if you feel more comfortable.</p>

        <p>The <b>Orientation Phase</b> (O-Phase) is intended to provide basic information for first-semester students about their studies. It is organized by the math, physics and computer science departments (also known as <a href="../fachschaft/">GAF</a>).</p>

            <h2>We ask all first-time applications <a href="https://www.portal.uni-muenchen.de/benutzerkonto/index.html#!/">to apply for and pick up</a> the LMUCard before the O-Phase, if possible!</h2>
        </div>

        <p><b>When?</b>does it take place? 10/08/2025 to 10/10/2025 (Wednesday to Friday in the last week before the start of the lecture period).</p>

        <p><b>Where</b> does it take place? You will find the meeting points for the respective days in the email that will be sent to you shortly before the O-Phase if you have registered. We will explore the university grounds and all important buildings so that you can get a first impression. If you do not have time from the beginning, you can also come to the <a href="../prospective/winter-o-phase/schedule">specified room</a> later for lectures. For other types of events, such as a university rally or a tour of the tutors, you can take a look at the <a href="../prospective/winter-o-phase#hq">headquarters</a>. If you are unsure where you can find which rooms, you can use the <a href="https://lmu.de/raumfinder/">LMU's room finder</a> for orientation.</p>

        <p><b>Who</b> can participate? New students in these <a href="../prospective/winter-o-phase/for-whom.html">subjects</a> - no matter whether Bachelor, <a href="../prospective/winter-o-phase.html#master">Master</a> or <a href="../prospective/winter-o-phase.html#teaching">teaching degree</a>t!</p>

        <p><b>What</b> awaits you? You can find the schedule here. We offer you the opportunity to get to know your new fellow students, the university, university life, the city and the student council, of which you will be part. As well as the opportunity to get all the important accounts and cards you need to study at once.</p>

For our planning, we ask you to register by September 10/01/2025, but in principle a later registration is also possible.</p>
