        <h1>Become a Tutor</h1>
        <p><b>For the experiences, <a href="https://tickets.fs.lmu.de/GAF/OPhase-25-helfen/">you can register directly here</a>.</b></p>

        <p>The O-Phase would not be possible without first aiders. Like once the students of higher semesters in your O-Phase, you can now stand by the new freshmen as a tutor. Anyone who has participated in the past knows that tutoring is fun, and those who have taken part first know how important it is to have a good tutor.</p>
        <p>To become a helper, please fill out the <a href="https://tickets.fs.lmu.de/GAF/OPhase-25-helfen//">registration</a> form. You will then receive an email for confirmation. In this email there is also a link to change your details afterwards (no re-registration is necessary).</p>
        <p>We are looking for <b>bachelor</b>'s and <b>master</b>'s degree courses as well as <b>students studying to become teachers</b> who can say something about a course in faculties 16 and 17.</p>

        <h2>Jobs</h2>
        <p>In addition to the mandatory job as a tutor, there are other jobs that are important for a successful O-Phase.</p>

        <h3>Tutor (on Thursday, 10/09/2025 tutor training on Wednesday, 10/08/2025)</h3>

        <p>You can team up with a fellow student and show the university to a small group of first-year students and explain the university life to them. After you have lunch with them in the cafeteria, you lead them through the buildings, give them orientation and answer their questions. But don't panic, we'll prepare you for it.</p>
        <p>On 08.10.2025 you will get an introduction and your T-shirt. More details will be announced here as soon as they are available. By the way there is also the <a href="../../prospective/winter-o-phase/schedule.html#beer-garden">beer garden</a> and a special presentation of <a href="../../prospective/winter-o-phase/schedule.html#special-information-events">u.Kino</a>. On 10/09/2025, detailed handouts are also available at the meeting point. If you should not know any more or if you encounter a problem, you can always get help by phone from our O-Phase office at <a href="tel:+498921804382">089 / 2180 4382</a>.</p>
        <p>You gather with the other fellow tutors 10/09/2025, in front of the lecture hall where the freshmen are getting an introduction to their field of study (Studienfachvorstellungen). Please be there at least 30 minutes in advance, as we may have to rearrange helpers and you have to splitup into groups. The tour itself ends at 4:30 p.m. by droping the freshman of at the <a href="../../prospective/winter-o-phase/schedule.html#how-do-i-study-properly">"How do I study properly? II"</a> lecture at <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de/raumfinder/index.html#/building/bw0000/map?room=002001120_">Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, N 120</a>.</p>
        <p>The list of introductions (Studienfachvorstellungen) will be listed here soon.</p>
        <p>To ensure that fun is not neglected, the traditional <a href="../../prospective/winter-o-phase/schedule.html#pub-crawl">pub crawl</a> begins at 6:30 p.m. With other tutor groups and the firsts you make the bars in the university district unsafe. For the transitional period, from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., you can wait for your firsts in <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de/raumfinder/index.html#/building/bw0000/map?room=002000020_">Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, N 020</a> and pass the time (the room has a projector).</p>

        <h3>Grillfest shift 1 & 2 (on Wednesday, 10/08/2025, from 3:00 to 9:30 p.m.)</h3>
