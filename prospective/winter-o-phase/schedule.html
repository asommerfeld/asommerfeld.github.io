        <p>The O-Phase should help you get off to a successful start in studying and getting to know your new classmates. But above all, it should be fun. To this end, we have put together a wide variety of events. The events take place indoors and outdoors (in almost any weather) and are spread over the entire university district. The schedule for each day is as follows.</p>

        <h2 id="greeting">Greeting</h2>
        <p>The O-Phase begins with a general greeting from official representatives of your faculties and the student council. You will be informed of the location and space after registration.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> In various university buildings, details can be found in a second email a few days before the O-Phase.</p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-study-properly">How do I study properly?</h2>

        <p>In these lectures you will learn from higher-semester students the best tips, tricks and tricks for a successful study and how you can get the most fun out of student life. Since studying is not an easy thing, the lectures are divided into two parts and distributed over the entire O-Phase.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday you will find out how you can best organize your studies (e.g. creating a timetable, setting up the university and your most important contacts). You can find out what offers there are at the university in addition to the lectures (e.g. university sports, free language courses, university groups) and all the information you need to finance your studies on Thursday.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> On Wednesday: Same place as greetin</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> On 10/09/2025: <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de/raumfinder/index.html#/building/bw0000/map?room=002001120_">Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, N 120</a> – the tutor tour takes you directly there</p>

        <h2 id="unirally">Unirally</h2>
        <p>The university buildings are huge and the surroundings full of interesting places. So that you know your way around in your pocket, you can explore the area on your own in small groups. Your group will be supported by giving you tasks that you should solve together. The group with the most correct (or most creative) answers will be announced on Thursday during the <a href="#how-do-i-study-properly">How do I study correctly? II"</a> lecture.</p>
        <p>During the university rally and the <a href="#beer-garden">beer garden</a> you can get your LMUCard, your combined student ID card, canteen card, library card and ticket for public transport. However, we strongly recommend that you complete the application (and, if possible, the collection) before the O-Phase, the university has provided you with the necessary information. This is needed for lunch on the <a href="#tour-of-tutors">tutor tour</a>, among other things.</p>

        <p>All master's students meet in the <b>Theresienstraße 39, CaféGumbel</b> and form their own groups.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> The destination is Theresienstrasse 39. The rally itself takes place outdoors in the university district.</p>


        <h2 id="beer-garden">Beer garden</h2>
        <p>Enjoy freshly roasted food (also vegetarian) with your fellow students from 4:00 p.m. Cool beer and other drinks are also available earlier. Special information events take place in parallel nearby.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Theresienstrasse 39, meadow to the Pinakothek der Moderne and in the building.</p>

        <h2 id="info-desk">Info desk</h2>
        <p>As part of the beer garden, there is an information desk in Café Gumbel. There you can ask questions about your degree program, studying in general, the O-Phase, the student council and what else you can think of. Here you can also register for the <a href="/prospective/ewo.html">EWO</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Theresienstraße 39, Café Gumbel</p>


        <h2 id="special-information-events">Special information events</h2>
        <p>You can get important information that does not affect everyone at special information events that take place parallel to the <a href="#beer-garden">beer garden</a>.</p>
        <p>A list of the special information events will be available here soon.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Theresienstraße 39</p>

        <h2 id="subject-presentation">Subject presentation</h2>
        <p>In the subject presentations I and II, you will receive important information about the course of your studies from representatives of the corresponding chairs, broken down by subject.</p>
        <p>The subject presentation I on Thursday is more extensive, which is why all students with only one subject are recommended to take part in it.</p>
        <p>The additional subject presentation II on Friday is for everyone who is studying a second subject, which is also covered by this O-Phase. This can be, for example, a subject as a minor, as a "integriertes Anwendungsfach" or as a teacher. This additional study subject gives you a brief overview of another subject. <b>The subject presentation II does not contain any additional content that does not appear in the subject presentation I.</b></p>
        <p>In special cases it can happen that a subject is only presented for one subject on one of the two days.</p>
        <p>The place and time of the subject introductions I will be announced.</p>
        <p>The place and time of the subject introductions II will be announced.</p>

        <h2 id="tour-of-tutors">Tour of tutors</h2>
        <p>Pack your hiking boots, because here you will be guided through the university area in small groups of tutors (students from your field of study). They show you where the most important buildings are, where there are libraries, where you can find cheap and good food, where you can work in peace or relax. It can also be the case that public transport is used. It is therefore advisable to have money or a ticket (e.g. semester ticket) with you. Since you will have lunch in the canteens, you will need your LMUCard, which you should apply for before the O-Phase and pick up at the latest during the <a href="#unirally">university rally</a>. Since you may create computer IDs and library IDs, you need your passport / ID card and student ID.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> The tour starts where your <a href="#subject-presetation">subject presentation I</a> takes place. Most of the tutor tour itself takes place outdoors.</p>

        <h2 id="pub-crawl">Pub Crawl</h2>
        <p>Explore the Munich pub scene in the university district with your classmates, tutors and experienced student representatives. This event is open end.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> You make it up with your tutors</p>

        <h2 id="hangover-processing-with-the-student-council">Hangover processing with the student council</h2>
        <p>If you want to get to know the people who organized this O-Phase (your student council) better and sometimes want to help organize events, then you can start the O-Phase relaxation day with us.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Theresienstraße 39. Café Gumbel.</p>

        <h2 id="board-game-afternoon">Board Game afternoon</h2>
        <p>We hope that new friendships have developed in the last two days. You can consolidate (or destroy again) these in various games.</p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Theresienstraße 39. In und um das Café Gumbel.</p>
